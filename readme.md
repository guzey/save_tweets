This is a script that gets a list of tweets to save as a .py file and saves each tweet's

1. id
2. date
3. author's screen name
4. author's name
5. text

In a CSV file, and saves each tweet's media (pictures/gifs/videos) in the 'media' folder.

It's written in Python 3 and uses tweepy to access Twitter.
