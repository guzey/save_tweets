This is a script that gets a list of tweets to save as a .py file and saves each tweet's

1. id
2. date
3. author's screen name
4. author's name
5. text

in a CSV file, and saves each tweet's media (pictures/gifs/videos) in the 'media' folder.

It's written in Python 3 and uses tweepy to access Twitter.

To run the script, create a [twitter app](https://apps.twitter.com/) and enter your credentials on lines 40-44 of save_tweets.py. An example of an input file is tweets.py
